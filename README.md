## Environment setup

Everything is stored inside a single Jupyter notebook. Further dependencies are installed from this notebook using pip.

1. Make sure you can open and run Jupyter notebooks (e.g., GoogleColab, VSCode + plugin, own server in docker).
2. Make sure you have pip installed. (Usually, it is already installed.)
